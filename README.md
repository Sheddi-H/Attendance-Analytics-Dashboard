# Attendance Sheet Dashboard in MS Access

## Project Objective
- The primary objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly dashboard in Microsoft Access that allows users to enter their personal information and course details, while also enabling administrators to manage and grade attendance effectively. The system aims to streamline attendance tracking and provide real-time data transformation to Excel for reporting purposes.
## Dataset Used
    - User Information:
        - Name

        - Date of Attendance
    - Admin Input:
        - Staff Information
        - Grades (Pass/Fail)
## Questions / Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
    - What is the average attendance rate across different courses?
    - How many users have passed/failed their courses?
    - What is the distribution of users by company?
    - Which courses have the highest/lowest attendance?
    - What are the trends in attendance over time?
## Process
    - Data Entry: Users can input their personal and course information through a dedicated form.
    - Admin Management: Admins can access user records to input grades and monitor attendance.
    - Search Functionality: Users can be searched in the database for quick access to their information.
    - Data Transformation: The system includes functionality to export attendance data to Excel for further analysis and reporting.
    - Dashboard Creation: A visually engaging dashboard is created to display relevant metrics and insights.
